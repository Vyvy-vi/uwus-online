# Security policy

## Reporting a security Vulnerability

If you see any security issues or vulnerabilities, kindly DO NOT open a github issue for the same. Instead alert us about this in our discord server or personally contact `@Vyvy-vi`

## Reporting potential security Improvements

Feel free to open an issue about what are the improvements, however it would be best if you could convey existing Vulnerabilities or Faults in a private conversation on a support ticket.

## Security updates to dependencies

Dependencies are automatically updated by dependabot, and we try to keep an eye on what packages are being used. Feel free to open an issue or PR if you think there's some safety issues with one of our dependencies.
